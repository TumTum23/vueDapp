# vue-blockchain-talk

> A Vue.js project that uses the power of Vue with a solidity contract and web3. All we are doing is creating a single interactive component to execute a contract on the ethereum network.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

There are instructions to build this app for production, but keep in mind that we
wont be pushing this component to production during our walkthrough. 

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
